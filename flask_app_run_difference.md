# Difference Between ```app.run()` and `if __name__ == "__main__": app.run()```

## 🔥 Case 1: `app.run() (Unconditional Execution)`



```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello from unconditional app.run()!"

# ❌ Always runs, even when imported
app.run(debug=True)
```

- **Problem:** If this file is imported elsewhere, the server runs automatically.
- **Use case:** Very quick, throwaway scripts only.

---

## ✅ Case 2: `if __name__ == "__main__": app.run()` (Safe Execution)

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello from __main__-guarded app.run()!"

# ✅ Only runs when script is executed directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

- **Benefits:**
  - Safe to import in other files.
  - Ideal for testing and larger applications.

## 🧪 Test Import Example

```python
# test_import.py
import app_unconditional   # ❌ This will run the server
# import app_main_check    # ✅ This won't run the server

print("Import test complete.")
```

---

## ✅ Recommendation

Always use:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
This makes your Flask app modular, testable, and production-ready.
```
